		<h1>Madison Indiana</h1>
		<p> With more than 133 blocks of outstanding architecture, Madison's
			downtown business district is one of the country's largest National Historic
			Landmark Districts. Madison's founders brought with them their own
			history, which is displayed in the architecture of the homes and buildings that
			make up this historic gem. Travel America says, ''Madison is an outdoor
		    museum of architecture.''</p>

		<p>There are 8 house museums that are open to the public during the season
			and several more open by advance appointment. They range from the office
			of a horse and buggy doctor (kids love the skeleton), to a 19th century
		saddletree factory, to grand homes.</p>

		<p>The crown jewel of Madison historic sites is Lanier Mansion State Historic
			Site-open all year with guided tours on the hour. Beautiful formal gardens
		surround the mansion.</p>
